# This workflow generates documentation (PDFs, interactive BOMs, board images). The
# The version number and date of the design is automatically updated in the schematic
# file and on the PCB. The version number is set via an environment variable
# and by default is `pre-release` since this runs outside of the release process
# so there's no formal release number to use.

# To use this workflow in your own repo you need to edit the environment variables in the env: section
# below.
