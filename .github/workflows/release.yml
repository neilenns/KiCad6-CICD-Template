# This workflow generates documentation (PDFs, interactive BOMs, board images) and fabrication
# files for JLCPCB and PCBWay. The version number and date of the design is automatically
# updated in the schematic file and on the PCB based on the GitHub release version and date.

# To use this workflow in your own repo you need to edit the environment variables in the env: section
# below.
